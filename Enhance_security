To make the system even more robust against persistent or sophisticated attacks, consider these improvements:

Progressive Lockout Durations:

Instead of a fixed 30-minute lockout, implement increasing lockout durations. For example:

5 failed attempts: 30 minutes lockout

10 failed attempts (after previous lockout expires): 1 hour lockout

15 failed attempts: 24 hours lockout

20+ failed attempts: Permanent manual review/lockout

This requires storing not just lockout_until but also the number of times an account has been locked or a more complex failed_login_attempts tracking that doesn't fully reset until successful login.

Global/Long-Term Failed Attempt Tracking:

Beyond consecutive failed attempts, track the total number of failed attempts over a much longer period (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days).

If a user has, say, 50 failed attempts in 24 hours, even if not consecutive, it could trigger a longer lockout or an alert to an administrator.

Honeypot Fields:

Add a hidden form field (CSS display: none;). Bots often fill in all fields. If this hidden field is filled, it's likely a bot, and you can immediately block the request or flag the IP. This is handled on the frontend.

CAPTCHA Integration (after a few failed attempts):

After 2-3 failed login attempts, introduce a CAPTCHA (e.g., reCAPTCHA v2/v3). This adds a human verification step that is very difficult for bots to bypass. This requires both frontend and backend integration.

IP Blacklisting/Whitelisting (Manual/Automated):

For extreme cases, if an IP is consistently abusive, you might manually blacklist it.

More advanced systems can automatically blacklist IPs that show highly suspicious patterns (e.g., thousands of attempts across many different accounts).

Monitoring and Alerting:

Integrate logging with an alerting system (e.g., Slack, email). If a certain threshold of failed logins or account lockouts is met, an administrator is notified to investigate.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA):

You already have a 2FA setup in your auth.routes.cjs. Encouraging or enforcing MFA for all users significantly increases security, as it requires a second factor (like a code from an authenticator app) even if the password is breached.

Conclusion on Security:

The current implementation (IP rate limiting + account lockout) is a strong foundation and addresses the most common brute-force attacks effectively for many applications. However, for applications with extremely high-value data or very strict security requirements, the more advanced measures listed above would be considered.
